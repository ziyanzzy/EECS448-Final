When I woke up my kids were still up watching cartoons !,That will mess you up for a few days. The only thing I don't like about going away./Oh no. Hopefully everybody gets back to normal soon.,I totally understand how disruptive changes in sleep schedules can be. It can take a few days to get back to normal after coming back from vacation. I hope you and your family can adjust and get back into your routine soon.
55,"I like getting things done in the yard , but I feel so dirty afterwards ./The grass makes me itchy , But the shower afterward feels great .",I only like yard work with the kids. They do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt./Oh no. The shower is the plus side to all the dirt I guess. I once found a snake digging a hole to plant a flower. I quit that day.,"I completely understand how you feel about feeling dirty after yard work, but it's amazing that you can have fun with your kids in the process. The shower must feel like a refreshing reward after all that hard work. Finding a snake certainly sounds like a scary experience, no wonder you quit that day."
56,"So the other day I had a crazy long day and got home to find all of my chocolate was gone !/I know right ! ... , but atleast I had some amaretto in the fridge .. lol",Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day./That's definitely better than nothing.

She normally is completely fearless , compared to my son who is afraid of everything . Haha ! So I love that she has worked so hard to overcome this ./Thats so special ! What a beautiful moment ..

How old is she? /My daughter is 1.5 years old - shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their ""first"" moments. Congrats mama! /She is 4. She normally is completely fearless, compared to my son who is afraid of everything. Haha! So I love that she has worked so hard to overcome this.",I would feel so touched hearing about how proud and happy the parent is of their daughter overcoming her fear of water and learning to swim. It's heartwarming to see a child conquering their fears and achieving something new. This special moment must be truly memorable for the family.
58,"Hi , I am concerned about the financial situation of my employer ./I do n't think it is a good idea . There was a layout off six month ago .",Have  you thought about talking to your boss about it?/You should still speak to him about your concerns.,"I understand your hesitation about bringing up such a sensitive topic, but it's important to address any concerns you have about your employer's financial situation. Your boss may have valuable insight or information that could help ease your worries. Don't be afraid to have an open and honest conversation."
59,So I am home from work and Marks car was outside . I went in and him and Liz were kissing on the couch ./I made them both leave but me and Liz are breaking up ./This is terrible . So sad to hear that . What did you do then ?,This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then?/Did she already move out?/I made them both leave but me and Liz are breaking up. ,I would feel incredibly hurt and betrayed if I walked in on my partner cheating on me. My heart would shatter knowing that our relationship is coming to an end because of their actions. I would need time to process the betrayal and figure out the next steps for myself.
60,Did you go outside and see if anyone was hurt ?/I heard a noise outside that sounded like a car had wrecked yesterday .,What do you mean? I don't know what you are talking about./Well then I guess you should have went and checked to see if anyone was hurt. I hope you called a ambulance.,"I would have immediately felt the urgency and concern in the conversation, and I would have asked for more information to understand the situation better. If I heard a noise that sounded like a car wreck, I would have definitely checked outside and called for help if someone was hurt. I can imagine the fear and anxiety that comes with the possibility of someone being injured, so I would have done my best to help in any way I could."
61,So after I left the club last night I noticed the Taxi had old throw up in it still ./I still took it since it was late but I rode in the front seat ./I would have gotten out right then I believe .,I would have gotten out right then I believe./I guess you rolled all the windows down too and held your breath/I still took it since it was late but I rode in the front seat.,"I would feel disgusted and uncomfortable hearing about someone having to ride in a taxi with old throw up in it. I would probably worry about their safety and hope they didn't catch anything from it. I would also empathize with their decision to still take the taxi, given the late hour and lack of other options."
62,"My marriage give me hopefulness about the life . exactly I want to say is may not it 's marriage actually it 's my wife given me the hope about the life ./Yeah , thank you ! at which situation did you feel hope for your life ?/Wow ! you 're right .

I can imagine the joy and love you must have felt when your daughter was born. Children truly have the power to remind us of the purity and innocence in the world."""
63,"The other day when I was cleaning I came across an old keychain my dad gave me when I was younger , it was nice to see ./Yeah it meant a lot to me - almost like a sign !",Thats good that you found the keychain/that's very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.  ,"Oh, that must have brought back a flood of memories. It's so touching to have something tangible to remember your dad by. Those little mementos truly hold so much sentimental value."
64,"My handyman keeps telling me he 's coming by to fix my leaky sink , but he never shows up when he says he will , ugh ./Oh yeah , and it goes to his answering machine every time ./That is seriously the worst ... waiting around all day wondering whats going on !

Have you tried calling him today? /Of course right, I would try angies list or homeadvisor! They can find you a new one.../Oh yeah, and it goes to his answering machine every time.",I would feel frustrated and disappointed by the handyman's lack of professionalism. I would also feel empathetic towards the person dealing with the situation. I would suggest using Angie's List or HomeAdvisor to find a more reliable handyman to fix the leaky sink.
65,"My co worker keeps getting told how great of a job he is doing and I know hes doing wrong to get all the sales ./Doubtful , but I sure hope so ! He gets a 100 dollar bonus every week because of his ways ..",Oh no. I am sure he will get caught eventually though./Things you do usually come back to you . ,"I feel a sense of frustration and disappointment hearing that someone is being rewarded for dishonest behavior. I empathize with the sense of injustice and can only hope that eventually they will face consequences for their actions. In the end, karma has a way of balancing things out."
66,It was amazing sitting on the stage in that hug auditorium ./Music . Some of the hardest music that professionals play ./What event was taking place ?,What event was taking place?/That's cool you were on stage for that. Were you one of the musicians?/Music. Some of the hardest music that professionals play.,"Wow, that sounds incredible! I can imagine the energy and passion that must have filled the auditorium during the performance. It must have been truly unforgettable to be on stage for such a powerful musical event."
67,I am satisfied to have a good vacation/Nothing special . I just travel to my familly . It has been almost a year that I did n't see them .,Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation? /Sounds rather special to me!

It must be such a proud moment for you as a parent. Your daughter is growing up so fast!"
69,"The other day after dinner my daughter took her trash to the trash on her own . I love watching her develop !/Shes just starting to try to say full sentences , but right now its just a lot of babbling and drooling . lol",It is so sweet. Is she able to talk?/That should be funny to see and hear,That sounds like such a heartwarming moment to witness her taking responsibility! Seeing children learn and grow is always so special.

Friendship is hard to come by these days... ","I would feel hurt and betrayed if my friend did that to me. I believe a true friend would be there to support and help each other out.

Your friendship is truly something special.

They even call the police a lot ./Yes , but I think they know the landlord .",What are they doing that is upsetting you?/Have you made a formal complaint against them yet?/You should report it to your local police department.

That's hilarious./I told her I had to go out of town and instead I just stayed home all day.,I would feel bad hearing that my friend lied to avoid spending time working out with Mary.

I would also offer support and suggest they have an open conversation with Mary to make things right.
96,Recently someone offered me an extreme amount of money for a work at home job .../It sounded too good to be true honestly it made me feel a little uneasy ... i had to turn it down !,"wow!

Now I'm by myself all the time.",I would feel empathetic towards the person and acknowledge their feelings of loneliness. I would suggest reaching out to their friends and trying to reconnect by throwing a party. I would also express support and suggest finding ways to make their living situation more enjoyable.
100,"I recently moved to my dream location , but it sucks not knowing anyone ./That actually sounds like a really good idea ! Thank you ... now to decide what to cook .. lol","congratulations!

Maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours/you can't go wrong with some grilled food :) burgers, wings, hot dogs ",I would be happy to attend and help out with the party to make sure you feel welcomed in your new location.

It just sucks because it is my favorite movie.,"As an emotional and empathetic human, I would feel disappointed and sad to hear that there won't be a sequel to Hot Fuzz. It's tough when things we love aren't able to continue due to lack of funding. I hope they reconsider in the future so fans can enjoy more of the movie."
103,"I was able to save a blind lady from falling down an escalator ./She was very alarmed and rightfully so .

Maybe that will work for you./That's good to hear. Where did you get it from?/I gotcha. I bought mine online too. ,I can totally relate to feeling self-conscious in a bathing suit.

I bet you made some good tips as well!/What let you on your career path to be a male stripper?

What sort of cooking do you like to do?/I love spaghetti myself! I'm not a good cook at all though. I'm always eating out./Yeah that's very true.

And when the flies start swarming , I get terrified and feel like I am going to come down with the bubonic plague .",I live in an apartment so I take mine out to the dumpster every few weeks. I feel your pain though. Growing up I had to take ours down our steep driveway every week./It is daunting. I think I still have nightmares about it.

Sometimes I think drivers are mad or confused at me , but they really just want to talk about the bike !/Oh , for sure . I always try to ride defensively and so I do n't cause offense to others , but it can really be random sometimes .","I bet that is an experience you are still trying to get used to/I see a lot of cars that do not watch out for motorcycles, be careful out there","I can imagine how unpredictable and nerve-wracking it must be to navigate traffic on a motorcycle. Safety should always be the top priority, so it's good that you are riding defensively.

I wish everyone could go to college if they wanted/yeah. if only,That's so wonderful that your brother achieved such a significant milestone for your family.

Did they react by laughing, helping, or ignoring?/I can see where that would be embarrassing.

I guess it does n't really matter what or who we provide for - as long as we 're all happy and doing our best !",Most definitely!. Dogs are important members of a family./Indeed. My son called our dog his cousin for a little while...weird I know.,I completely understand the bond between a person and their dog. Dogs truly do become important members of the family.

It's important to follow your interests and stay committed to the path that feels right for you. I'll be cheering you on as you work towards graduation in criminal justice!
1022,"My friend ended up in the hospital after an accident a few weeks ago , there was a period of time they did n't know if he 'd make it ./He is okay now , just dealing with a head injury and some broken bones .

I might also suggest reporting the reckless driver to the authorities to prevent similar incidents in the future."
1024,"Hi , I feel bad after my reaction to brother joke . Now , he is angry against me ./I told him that he is stupid . I should n't have said that even something joke very bad","Oh no that's unfortunate, did you make fun of him or something?/Oh, well sometimes we say things we don't mean.

I didn't have that problem in MExico/It was two years ago. I cant remember where. We stayed on the beach all day.,I would feel sorry for them dealing with the constant electricity outages. I would try to empathize with their frustration and offer my sympathy. I might also share my own experience visiting Mexico and how fortunate I was to not encounter any power issues.
1031,MY daughter is going to eigth grade this year and wants to try out for lacrosse/It 's kind of like soccer but they use some weird stick .

1033,"so a couple weeks ago i went out partying with some friends and while we were drinking my friend went out to do drugs to feel better but since i was his bestfriend i didnt like to see him throw his life away like that and mentioned that we were already drinking he didnt need to get higher but he refused so i started yelling to chill out and he shoved me to the ground . i felt he chose the drugs over friends/yeah but there is always a time and a place and if i invite my bestfriend to have a good night and he decides to do his own thing it annoys me , as i hate seeing him like that and after that i felt the night was just ruined ./I can see why you feel that way . Sometimes addicts are n't in full control of their decisions , though .","I can see why you feel that way. Sometimes addicts aren't in full control of their decisions, though./I think you have a right to be mad over that. /yeah but there is always a time and a place and if i invite my bestfriend to have a good night and he decides to do his own thing it annoys me, as i hate seeing him like that and after that i felt the night was just ruined. ","I would feel hurt and betrayed by my friend's actions, and I would be frustrated by the way the night turned out. It's tough to see someone you care about making self-destructive choices, but ultimately it's up to them to make the changes they need to. I would probably need some time to process my feelings and decide how to move forward in the friendship."
1034,"I went to my mom 's for dinner two nights ago and she did n't even cook the chicken all the way through . I nearly threw up at the table ./I ca n't yell at her for it , she is getting up in age and is trying her best .

I would sympathize with them and offer to help by providing advice on cooking meat properly or even assisting during future dinner preparations to ensure it won't happen again. Eating raw chicken can be dangerous and I would want to ensure their mom's well-being by providing some guidance on how to avoid it."
1035,"Just moved to a new city , new work , and I 've got no friends ./I have , but it 's pretty tough with my schedule .","Have you tried making any?/maybe try going out to concerts or clubs or sporting events, somewhere you can find people with common interests",I totally understand how challenging it can be to make new friends in a new city. Maybe you can try joining some local clubs or groups where you can meet people who share your interests. And don't be afraid to put yourself out there and make the effort to connect with others.
1036,"My neighbors always have company . People are constantly parking in fron of my apartent ./It a small complex , and visitor parking is far . That 's where they should park though . Its annoying",Oh no. Is there a lot of parking available?/I agree. I had an apartment with limited parking and people that didn't live there always parked there anyway.,I can understand how frustrating that must be for you. It's important for visitors to respect designated parking areas. I hope your neighbors eventually find a better solution for their guests' parking.
1037,Do you have kids ? My daughter will be 14 soon . I do n't want her to grow up ./She is so smart and outgoing . I know she is going to want to leave the state for college .

I feel you.. if I ever had a daughter I'd be overprotective and stressing/Nope lock her in the basement/She is so smart and outgoing. I know she is going to want to leave the state for college. Nooooo,"I would nod my head sympathetically and say, ""It must be hard to see your daughter grow up so quickly. You must be so proud of her accomplishments."" Then, I would express understanding and say, ""I can imagine wanting to protect her and keep her close. It's natural to worry about letting go."" Lastly, I would reassure them and say, ""But it's important to support her dreams and help her become independent. She'll always have your love and guidance."""
1038,"I want dry , breezy , and sunny weather the whole week dang it/:45 min from where I live ... South Padre Island , white sand gorgeous girls and cheap liquor",Where can you get that kind of weather./You had me at cheap liquor,I would probably chuckle at the emphasis on finding a specific type of weather. I might joke that it sounds like a dream location with white sand and cheap liquor. And I would agree that those are definitely enticing factors for a quick getaway.
1039,My best friend has alwas been there for me ./Our friends have even grown up together and we met at a job that we both hated . She is like my sister ./That 's cool . It 's good to have loyal friends,That's cool.

I bought a spin bike in January and have used it once. I have to quit smoking.,"I understand how frustrating it can be to not hit your usual bench press max, but don't be too hard on yourself. Eating healthier is definitely a good place to start, and quitting smoking would also greatly improve your overall health and fitness. Maybe try incorporating more regular workouts with your spin bike to help you reach your goals."
1041,I was at the club yesterday and my brother left me . I knew he was coming back though . He just wanted a taco/What do you mean by that,"This happens many times, they just don't care of us/our siblings, leaving us all alone in a party or a club.",I would feel abandoned and hurt if my siblings did that to me. It would be hard to trust that they care about me if they constantly left me alone. I would hope they realize how their actions affect me and make an effort to change.
1042,"I was listening to this random music playlist on Youtube and then this song that I had n't heard since I was a kid , that I had completely forgotten about , came on and brought back all these childhood memories ./It was this song by the band `` Cake '' that my parents used to play all of the time in the car . I ca n't remember the name though ./What was the song ?","What was the song?/Is it short skir't long jacket. I love that song./It was this song by the band ""Cake"" that my parents used to play all of the time in the car. I can't remember the name though. ","Oh, I know exactly how you feel!

Do you know what/My landlord has the same issue. /Yes same for me just have to fix up the credit score a bit more ha./I have lived here so long and every new team is th same.,I would feel really sorry for them dealing with such a crappy living situation. It must be really frustrating to have to put up with it for so long. I hope they are able to find a better living situation soon.
1044,"I was pregnant and I went in to labor in the middle of the night unexpectedly . I did n't have reliable transportation and the taxi company was closed so I had to call a friend who I had n't seen in a long time and luckily she was able to take me ./It was , I had a quick labor and I did n't have time to get an epidural once I got there .

It was my least favorite birth of all of my kids, the next one was better though. ","I would feel a rush of empathy for the person sharing their story, imagining the stress and pain they must have gone through. I would express my relief that everything turned out okay in the end and that their next birth experience was better. I would offer my support and sympathy for what they had to endure."
1045,I love that feeling of finishing a bomb workout at the gym ... then catch 5 cute girls staring and shyly look away and their boyfriends giving me salty looks/Yup every time ./Wow is that really something that happens ?,Wow is that really something that happens?/I don't think I believe you. /Yup every time.,"I would feel a mix of emotions hearing this statement. On one hand, I would feel happy for the person for achieving a great workout. On the other hand, I would feel a sense of discomfort and disbelief at their boastful attitude towards others' reactions. Overall, I would try to show understanding and empathy towards their need for validation."
1046,I ran out of funds for college and they want me to get a private loan ./I do n't want too much debt ./I think that 's my only option now .,"Well, is that something you can do?/Right, well is there any other way?/Look carefully before you sign.",I would feel sympathetic towards the person facing financial difficulties for their education. I would try to reassure them that there may be other options available and encourage them to explore those alternatives before committing to a private loan. I would also urge them to carefully consider the terms and implications of taking on additional debt.
1047,My family has been very nice lately ./It 's off an on for some reason . I can never tell why .,That's cool. Was it not like that before?/My family is like that too. ,"I would say, ""I can relate, sometimes I can't figure out why my family's moods fluctuate either. It's nice when they're being nice though. Family dynamics can be so unpredictable."" 

I might add, ""It's comforting to know I'm not alone in experiencing this kind of uncertainty with family. We're all just trying to navigate through these complex emotions together."""
1048,"My brother was coming back from a trip . I was expecting from him to bring to me a gift ./Nothing , I was so supprised by that .",He didn't bring you anything?/That's strange. I always try to buy gifts for my family when I go on a trip.,I would feel disappointed and hurt if my brother didn't bring me a gift after coming back from a trip. It would make me question his thoughtfulness and consideration towards me. I believe small gestures like gifts are a way of showing love and appreciation for one another.
1049,"Hey , I was talking a walk the other day and I accidentally stepped in some dog poop , talk about gross ./I 'm glad for you , people need to clean up after their animals !",Ewww. I haven't done that in a while. Thankfully./They sure do. Isn't it the law?,"Oh no, that sounds really unpleasant! I hope you were able to clean it off quickly. It's definitely important for pet owners to clean up after their animals to keep the environment clean and safe for everyone."
1050,"I wake up to a dead cell phone every single morning ./I charge it every night . My son steals it to watch youtube videos and falls asleep with it on ./Oh that 's the worst , I try to remember to charge but it 's hard to remember every time .","Oh that's the worst, I try to remember to charge but it's hard to remember every time./So he's the culprit! He better start charging it or else it's revoked !/I charge it every night. My son steals it to watch youtube videos and falls asleep with it on.",I completely understand the struggle of trying to remember to charge your phone every night. It must be frustrating to have your son constantly using and draining your phone battery. It sounds like a never-ending cycle of charging and use.
1051,"I was at the store the other day with my husband . A friend called my name and we went over to see them ./We were just getting groceries , but I introduced the friend to my husband and used the wrong name ! ! !","What were you guys looking to buy?/I've done that more than once, I'm terrible at names","Oh, that sounds embarrassing!

People do that all the time as long as the person they tell is closer to them/Everyone believes that of course, but I believe you, people make mistakes","I can understand why you would feel bad about breaking a promise to keep a secret. It takes a lot of courage to admit when we make mistakes, and it shows that you are truly reflective and empathetic. Remember, we are all human and it's important to learn and grow from our experiences."
1456,"School is about to start . We are ready ./Yep . My daughter is so excited . I am glad summer is over ./Ugh I remember those days !

A lot of people would just break down instead of trying to help however they can./Good for you, I'm sure your dad is so very thankful for you.",I would feel immense empathy for the speaker's situation and admire their strength and selflessness. It must have been extremely difficult for them to take on the responsibility of caring for their dad during such a challenging time.

1463,I miss my ex ./He kept gambling away our bill money so I had to let him go .,"I am sorry to hear that, how did it end between you?/That makes sense, sometimes things are just not meant to be",I'm so sorry to hear that you had to go through that.

But forgive her and let her make it up to you./yeah, It's our 2nd anniversary. ",I would feel sad and disappointed that my partner forgot our special day. I would likely communicate my feelings to them and hope for an apology and effort to make it up to me. It's important in any relationship to address and work through these kinds of misunderstandings with understanding and forgiveness.
1472,"I was so scared when my dad used to scare me as a kid/I guess he was just having fun , but I was not having as much","Dads can be strange like that sometimes.

I want to catch them !,Maybe someone is playing a trick on you/Set a trap. Or maybe just a camera,I would feel anxious and on edge knowing that someone might be trying to play a prank on me. I would probably set up a trap to catch the culprit in the act and confront them. I would also consider installing a camera to keep an eye on my door for any suspicious activity.
1819,I promised myself I would exercise more ./Terrible . I have literally done nothing ./How 's it going with that ?,How's it going with that?/hahaha I've been that way too./Terrible.

If that doesn't work, I would suggest finding a compromise or possibly reevaluating our living situation. Taking drastic actions like throwing away belongings or kicking them out would only create more tension and escalate the situation."
1833,"I love being independent ./The best thing is not having to explain anything to anyone . I love it/Yea , you can do whatever you want .","Yea, you can do whatever you want./That's for sure. How long have you had your independence?/The best thing is not having to explain anything to anyone. I love it",I completely understand where you're coming from. It's empowering to be in control of your own choices. The freedom to live life on your own terms is truly a wonderful feeling.

It's disappointing when a vacation doesn't meet your expectations. I live in [location], if you're ever looking for travel recommendations outside of typical tourist experiences."

Small dogs like that make excellent companions. Do you plan on keeping him?/Yes! He was in front of a grocery store..so hot! and so many passed by and he was asking for help. He got a great home!","Oh my goodness, that breaks my heart to hear about the poor little dog left in the heat! I'm so glad he found a loving home in the end.

I rescue bambi and small critters :)","I feel really sad hearing about hunting small animals, especially coming from a place of excitement. I would feel more fulfilled rescuing and preserving wildlife rather than harming them. I would hope to find common ground with the speaker on our love for animals, just in different ways."
1837,"My friend 's mom is n't doing too well ./She fell suddenly , had to get surgery and now she has n't woken up from it .",That's too bad to hear. What's wrong with her?/That's incredibly awful. At least the surgery fixed the injury (I assume). Did the doctors say when she is going to wake up?,I'm so sorry to hear that your friend's mom is going through this. I can't even imagine how difficult it must be for both of them. I hope the doctors are able to provide some answers and that she wakes up soon.
1838,"Last night , I did the most unfortunate thing . I ate three entire bags of Totinos 250 count pizza rolls ./At the time it seemed like a brilliant idea . But afters , I felt like a disgusting blob . God bless the Great and Noble Lord Totino .","Think I've done that, too. No regrets, my friend./They are tasty sins.",I completely understand how you're feeling. Overindulging on comfort food can sometimes leave us feeling guilty and sluggish. Just remember to be kind to yourself and focus on making healthier choices moving forward.
1839,The weekend was so chill and quiet . Now my kids are back/Yes . I think they have gotten even louder since they left Saturday . Geez .,"are they being loud and annoying like usual?/Ugh, well good think mine are still at summer camp.","I would empathize with the frustration of the loud and annoying kids, but also understand that it's just part of being a parent. I might share a light-hearted anecdote about my own kids being at summer camp to offer some relief from the current situation. Overall, I would try to show understanding and solidarity with the speaker's feelings."
1840,Back in high school i ran the game club . My normal ride made left me early ./We set up game consoles and just play video games for 2 hours . But i had to call my grandma to pick me up .,What's game club/Sounds like a fun club though. My school didn't have anything like that.,I would feel sorry for the person having to call their grandma for a ride and missing out on the club fun.

I would also express enthusiasm for the idea of a game club and share my own experiences with similar activities.

Doesn't he know that is forbidden/That's so sad :( Maybe he should buy you a substitute","I would feel disappointed and upset that I didn't get to enjoy a Twinkie. It's frustrating when someone eats the last one without considering others' feelings. I agree, maybe your brother should make it up to you by getting you a replacement."
1843,Found someone 's scarf the other day and returned it to her . She completely bawled ./It was just a scarf . Did n't think it would have such value for her .,that was nice of you/it could have been sentimental. like a gift from someone special,I would have likely felt a surge of warmth and satisfaction knowing that my gesture brought someone to tears. It shows that small acts of kindness can truly make a difference. I would have felt happy knowing that the scarf held sentimental value for her.

How'd that go?/That must've been embarassing. Happens to us all.,I would feel mortified and embarrassed if that happened to me. I would probably want to just disappear out of shame. It's a situation no one wants to be in.

He must be an incredible person.

1847,"Last night was quite a low point in my life . I ordered 12 Big Mac 's from the drive thru of McDonalds ./They are , but I felt so ashamed . Not because I ate so much , but because I did n't order enough .","Big Mac's are heaven in your mouth./I mean you can still go back for more after this. Don't give up, bro.","Hey, I hear you. It's okay to have moments where we indulge, but it's important to also recognize when we might be using food to cope.

1848,"What did you buy for Black Friday ?/Lol , I went to best buy to buy a surround sound system , echo dots and smart lighting bulbs ./I stayed at home - I hate trying to fight over that 50 % off pack of pencils at Staples .

Figures that email was too good to be true .,"I'm sorry to hear that, what led you to this?/Yea, you need to stay away from those, especially if you don't know who they are, your email should be able to block stuff like that, look in the settings.",I'm so sorry to hear that you had to go through such a difficult time. It must have been really tough for you to go dumpster diving for food. Please know that I am here for you and am willing to support you in any way that I can. Let's work together to find a way to get through this tough situation.
1850,"At work , I am often the only employee in my building ./It 's a small company and the other folks in my department just work part time ./Why is that ?","Why is that?/Oh wow, you must have a lot of responsibility there!/It's a small company and the other folks in my department just work part time. ","I would feel both sorry and concerned for this person, as it can be very isolating and overwhelming to be the only employee in a building. I would offer my support and encouragement, acknowledging the weight of responsibility that comes with their position in a small company. I would also express admiration for their hard work and dedication in managing such a challenging situation."

We are still together and she actualy did change",Why didnt it work out?/Oh well that's good.,I would express empathy for the struggle to trust and offer support for the difficulties faced in the relationship.

I can only imagine how frightening it must be to cross streets now. I hope the person who was hit is okay."

Just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interviewers :)/Cool! What industry is it in? I hope you get the job!,"Don't worry, I know how nerve-wracking job interviews can be.

I always donate their old stuff instead of selling it ./Can you explain more ?,Can you explain more?/Donate is good thing to do. Great/I can afford to buy my kids things. I always donate their old stuff instead of selling it.,I feel grateful for the ability to provide for my children but also guilty knowing not all families have the means to do so. Donating their old things instead of selling them feels like a small way I can give back and help others in need. It's important to remember to give back and support those who may be less fortunate than ourselves.

Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people !","Don't feel bad, many people are experiencing the same feelings.

What makes it worse , is my coworker knew I was being left with his stuff and he made no attempt to close anything out !",That's not fair. Why didn/That's terrible. Maybe you can get a promotion if you get it all done.,"I would feel frustrated and overwhelmed in that situation, having to take on another person's workload without any support.

But sometimes I feel like she 's enabling him and acts as a crutch for him . Do n't know if it 's my business to say so , though",Thats very admirable./Enabling is pretty bad. People don't learn if someone is always saving them from every thing.,I would feel a mix of pride for the mom's selflessness and concern for the potential enabling behavior. It's important to address these feelings with the family while expressing support and understanding. Offering to communicate concerns in a loving and respectful way could help start a helpful conversation.

But she loves me for me , so she was able to accept it , and I 've started working towards almost finishing the education I lied about having in the first place .",Did you ever come clean?/That's good. I always like about not understanfing football when I meet a guy. It makes them feel good lol,"I would empathize with the need to hide insecurities in relationships, but also feel relieved that honesty ultimately strengthened the trust between them. I would encourage the importance of being authentic and open in a partnership, even if it means facing difficult conversations. I would also appreciate the humor in pretending not to understand football to make someone else feel good."
1873,"I lost my dog the other day . They were my best friend since 12 . Do n't know what I 'm going to do ../i really appreciate that . It 'll be hard ... Especially for my son .

But tonight seems a bit lonely with no one around ./No but I too have a dog that is great company .,"Sorry to hear that. I'm in the same boat. At least I have two dogs with me. Do you have any friends around/Yeah, they can be. Except these guys get really rowdy when there's a thunderstorm (like there will be tonight, sadly...). What about yours?","I would say, ""I know how you feel, it can be lonely at night sometimes. Having a dog for company must be comforting. Dogs have a way of bringing warmth and joy even in the midst of a storm."""
1879,I really get scared when I am around dogs ./I got bite by a dog when I was little .,Some dogs can be very intimidating. I can understand that.

I've been around my siblings kids long enough to know how rough they can be, even though I don't have my own. How old are they, if you don't mind me asking?/Dang.. I love Dr. Pepper too. They can be selfish sometimes, but we just have to remember that they have developed the parts of their brain to make them care about more than just themselves./3 and 4. They came running in here and wasted my last Dr Pepper. ","I can imagine how frustrating that must be, especially when it's your last drink. Kids can be a handful sometimes, but their developmental stage can make them act selfishly. I hope you can find a way to deal with their behavior and maybe hide your precious Dr. Pepper next time."

I can only imagine how frustrated and embarrassed you must have felt having to clean it up. Buying some air freshener sounds like a good idea to help with the smell."
1886,"I know my Falcons will win the Super Bowl this year ./Yes , I was at that game .","Falcons fan, huh? That's cool. I like the Green Bay Packers. You guys knocked us out of the playoffs a couple years ago because of our bad defense :(/Are you serious? I bet that was fun, to see you guys get to the Super Bowl on that. Memorable night.",I would feel a sense of empathy for the person and understand their disappointment of losing that important game. I would also feel a tinge of happiness for the person getting to experience such a memorable moment. I might share in their excitement for the team making it to the Super Bowl.
1887,I beat all of the crazy crowds for back to school shopping ./I went shopping weeks ago . They need the same stuff every year ./That was smart .,That was smart./I hope you didn't pay full price./I went shopping weeks ago. They need the same stuff every year.,I would feel a sense of accomplishment for avoiding the rush of back to school shopping. I might also feel a bit of pride for planning ahead and saving money by buying things early. I would sympathize with the other person for having to deal with crowded stores and potentially paying full price.
1888,I am really worried I will let my father down ./Cause I usually mess up .,Why would you think that?/Try hard not too. That's the best you can do,"I understand how you feel, it's natural to worry about letting down loved ones. Just remember that everyone makes mistakes, it's part of being human. Keep trying your best, that's all anyone can ask for."
1889,"Ate the last biscuit this morning during breakfast . Then my child came in asking for another one and I felt really bad . Oh well . Maybe I 'll get her something as a treat tomorroow ./Hah . Yeah , I 'm the same way . But sometimes it 's hard to plan how much they want to eat !",It really makes a parent feel bad when that happens. I live with what my neighbor calls mom guilt./very difficult. If you hadn't eaten it the child most likely wouldn't have wanted it.,I can totally relate to feeling guilty in situations like that. It's tough being a parent sometimes. I think treating your child tomorrow is a sweet gesture to make up for it.
1890,"Did n't get to exercise today . I feel like I 'm lazy/It 's almost 9 , and I still have work to do . I want to go jogging , but I do n't think I have time (","You can still exercise now./You should do it, even 15 minutes.","I understand how you're feeling, but don't be too hard on yourself. Even just a short walk or some stretching can make a difference. Taking care of your physical and mental health is important, so try to find a small window of time to prioritize yourself."
1891,I wish I had more friends ./I am very sky .,"I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you struggle to communicate with people?/Shy? Yeah, I get that. I was too, until I started getting out more.

If you ever need someone to talk to or hang out with, I'm here for you."
1892,"Really hoping my brother comes through and can fix my car so that I do n't have to spend as much money to fix it . Otherwise , I do n't know how I 'll pay rent/Yeah , no kidding . If he ca n't , I 'm doomed .",It is stressful situation. I hope your brother find time to help you./Sorry to hear that,"I'm so sorry you're going through such a stressful situation, that sounds really tough.

I was so scared .","that's crazy. Snakes are one of my worst fears. Was it poisonous, do you know?/Hah. I would have to. I would have booked it the second I saw it. People could prank me easily with fake snakes if they wanted to.",I can't even imagine how terrifying that must have been for you. Just the thought of a snake in a well gives me chills. I would have probably screamed and ran away too.
1894,"Its frustrating to get paid less than other people when you are doing their job/They were just being lazy , and the work had to get done , so I had to do it/Wow , you are ? How did you find out ?","Wow, you are? How did you find out?/What do you do, if you don't mind me asking?/They were just being lazy, and the work had to get done, so I had to do it",I would feel upset and unappreciated if I were in that situation. It's not fair to be paid less for doing someone else's job because they were lazy. I would try to have a conversation with my manager or HR to address the issue.
1895,"Even though they 're in their 60s and have been together for the past 30 years , my mom and dad still get giddy around each other . Makes me happy/I do ! We 've been together for six years .

How about you ?","Thats really awesome that they are still so much in love.  do you have a significant other?/Awesome! my wife and I got married 2 years ago, I hope we make it 30 years like your parents!",That's so heartwarming to hear about your parents! It must be wonderful to see their love after all these years. I'm rooting for you and your wife to have a long and happy marriage like them!
1896,My dog ran away and some kind person brought him back to me/I know I was so thankful and happy to have him back,That's so awesome! So many times they don't come back. /Fantastic! What kind of dog is he?,"I would feel relieved and grateful hearing that their dog was returned to them.

At what age does that normally happen? 3?/MY son is 3 1/2 those are baby poops. He refuses to use the potty though.","I can empathize with your frustration as changing dirty diapers can be exhausting. Potty training can vary for each child, but typically around 3 years old is a good time to start. Hang in there, it will get easier with patience and consistency."
1899,"There 's a fly inside this house and I ca n't , for the life of me , kill it . I 'm trying to work peacefully and it just keeps buzzing around/Yeah , they are . Especially when they seem to be particularly skilled at being elusive for whatever reason . Like some of them just got additional expert training or whatever",I hate that. Flies and gnats are so annoying/Lol. It does seem like that sometimes. They can sit on the blinds for forever and move at the last second when you swing the swatter. Like Seal Team Six flies or something.,I would feel a sense of frustration and annoyance at the pesky fly interrupting someone's work and peace. I would empathize with their struggle to catch the elusive insect and feel a shared sense of irritation towards flies and gnats. I might offer to help catch the fly or suggest some tips for trapping or swatting it.

Sorry I meant alive- It is very scary to be in the hospital and having others take care of you/I am glad your ok .,I am glad your ok./I was in a car wreck once./Thank you!

When is the wedding?/Wow that's right around the corner!  New Orleans is the PERFECT place for a celebration, too!","I would be overjoyed for my little sister and excited to celebrate her wedding day. New Orleans is such a great choice for a wedding venue, it's sure to be a beautiful and memorable event. I can't wait to be there and help make it a special day for her."
1903,"The other day I won $ 100 on a scratch off lottery ticket and I could n't believe my luck/I was shocked ! I am currently saving up money for a vacation , so it all just went towards that/I have n't won on a ticket in a long time , but I once one $ 300 ! ! Spend it on anything fun ?","I haven't won on a ticket in a long time, but I once one $300!! Spend it on anything fun?/Hey that's still fun! I spent mine on paying off a credit card in part, which is boring but lead to more money in the long run./I was shocked!

It was a complete gut reaction . I thought I did n't deserve to go to jail . But now I realize I do ./Why did you lie ?,Why did you lie?/How long will you go for?/I was just scared in the moment. It was a complete gut reaction. I thought I didn't deserve to go to jail. But now I realize I do.,"I can only imagine the fear and guilt you must be feeling right now. It takes a lot of courage to admit to a wrong and take responsibility for your actions. I hope that by facing this head on, you can start to find some peace and closure."
1905,"I ca n't believe I used salt instead of sugar in the cake I baked ./Yes , it was a disaster .","Whoaa.... You probably had to throw that away immediately, huh? Don't worry, my sister-in-law forgot to put eggs in a cake one time and it came out like a brick./Well, you live and you learn. At least you can bake, or try to. I don't hardly cook at all, besides simple things!","Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that happened! Baking mishaps can be really frustrating. But hey, mistakes happen and it's all part of the learning process! Maybe next time double check the ingredients before baking."

That's incredible. What caused the change, finally?/I've heard about people doing that... Man, it's incredible how much your diet can affect you. I'm really happy for you guys.",That must have been such a challenging 12 years for both you and your wife. I'm so glad to hear that things are finally looking up. It's amazing how much of an impact diet can have on our overall health and well-being.
1907,"I sure am glad I have the mother that I do . She 's so patient and forgiving , and kind and caring . She 's helped me become the good person that I am today/I know ..

Very lively dinner table .","Big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day. Was it a pretty long day for you?/Haha I bet! Always great to have everyone together, though, really gets your mind off all the stresses of daily life.","I would say: ""That sounds like such a lovely way to end the day, surrounded by family and good food.

I wish it could just go on forever, because I've become so invested in the characters and the storyline. It's tough saying goodbye to something that has brought me so much entertainment and joy."

What do you think you'll do about it?",I feel upset and disappointed that my coworker would do this. I would definitely talk to my coworker about it and try to find a solution. It's important to address this issue and make sure it doesn't happen again.
1934,"Sitting next to my baby brother who 's two-years-old , and he 's just ripping farts . Really wish I did n't have to stay with my parents during the summer while college is out/Kind of used to it.Comes with the territory of being with a kid brother . How about you ? Any siblings ?","Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations?/Yes i do have 2 siblings, older brother and younger sister, but we dont fart in front of eachother, i love them!","I would probably giggle and try to lighten the mood to ease the embarrassment. It's just a natural bodily function, nothing to be ashamed of. Siblings bond in weird ways, fart jokes included!"
1935,"Watched an old Tv show I watched as a kid -- a cartoon . Reminded me of the time I used to spend with my brother after school , when there was nothing we had to care or worry about/Yeah . It was the show Dragon Ball Z , some kids cartoon . We 're not that close anymore , but I wish we could go back to those days for a moment , sometimes .",Sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free./Oh man! I grew up on that cartoon too!,That sounds like such a nostalgic and special memory. I can understand the longing to go back to those carefree days with your brother. It's amazing how TV shows can bring back such strong emotions and connections.
1936,I pirated a few games recently and I 'm enjoying the hell out of them . I sort of feel guilty for not supporting the developers though ./Older ? I 'm thirty ! But now I have kids and money is tight sometimes . I might still buy the guys soon ./Yeah ... that 's a tough one . I 've pirated stuff before . Kind of how it goes as a poor college student . Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately .,"Yeah... that's a tough one. I've pirated stuff before. Kind of how it goes as a poor college student. Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately./Hahaha... Good point. I understand. Some things are just more important, fair point. My fault on assuming your age./Older? I'm thirty! But now I have kids and money is tight sometimes. I might still buy the guys soon.",I would empathize with their struggle of financially supporting developers while also wanting to enjoy the games. I would encourage them to consider supporting the creators when they are able to. And I would reassure them that their current situation and priorities are understandable.
1937,"Saw my brother graduate college last month ! Felt so happy for him finally achieving what he 's worked hard for . Hope he gets a job soon , though/Ah , he 'll be under a lot of stress . Hopefully you guys can maintain your relationship through it all , as college tends to sweep people away and take up all their attention .","That's awesome, the exact opposite is true for me. My little brother is just about to start his first year of college next month!/Yes, I hope so. Well, I hope your brother can put his degree to good use and make some moolah!","I would feel happy for my friend's brother for graduating and achieving his goals, it's great to see someone succeed. I would also feel a sense of empathy for my friend as their little brother starts college, understanding the stress and pressure that can come with it. Lastly, I would express hope that both relationships can withstand the challenges and changes that come with these milestones."
1938,I 've been pretty pissed off about the slow internet speeds lately . I think it 's the weather ?/I think it 's time to get a new ISP ! Any recommendations ?,"Who knows.. I've dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP./Not really, especially since they vary sometimes by region. We should just move to Europe, I hear they have great internet there because they actually view it as important.",I totally understand your frustration with slow internet speeds. It's so frustrating when it interferes with your daily life. Moving to Europe does sound tempting for better internet!
1939,I have bad panic attacks about death after experiencing so much of it the past year/Yes people and pets . Too soon . So it definitely makes you think everyone is going to die any minute and life is meaningless ./I am so sorry to hear that . I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately ?,"I am so sorry to hear that. I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately?/sadly we all know that everyone and everything is going to die, but that is why we need to really live while we are able. Don't retreat. Embrace everyone who is close to you./Yes people and pets. Too soon. So it definitely makes you think everyone is going to die any minute and life is meaningless.","I am sorry to hear that you have been experiencing panic attacks about death. It must be incredibly difficult to go through so much loss in such a short amount of time. Please remember that it is normal to feel overwhelmed and scared, but it is important to focus on the love and memories you shared with those no longer here."
1940,"I could n't sleep last night at all , I kept hearing some weird bumping sounds that made me think someone was walking up and down my stairs but I live alone ./I do and that 's the first thing I thought it could be .","Thats so scary, do you believe in ghosts?/Hope it's a friendly one at least.",I would feel anxious and uneasy after hearing those strange sounds. It's understandable to believe in ghosts when experiencing something unexplainable. I hope you can find a way to feel more secure and at peace in your home.
1941,"Yesterday , I took a flight . During the flight , I went to toilet and a woman came just after me . She kept knocking on the door repeatedly , aggressively and multiple times ./She made me mad . She considering that normal . I told she should take a seat in first class so she could have a toilet for herself .","Haha.  Makes it hard to take care of business, and you'd think she'd get the hint from the locked door!  I would have sat longer ""just because.""/Maybe her first class seat should be on the royal porcelain seat!","Wow, that sounds like a really frustrating experience. I can't imagine how uncomfortable it must have been for you. It's important to remember to be considerate of others and their privacy, especially in a small space like an airplane."
1942,I just moved to a new city for work . I do not know anyone that lives here ./You 're right I will do that eventually . That is a good way to change my situation rather than sulking around .,You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others!/It is.  It isn't healthy to be by yourself for too long.  Humans are social creatures!,I would feel motivated to put myself out there and make an effort to meet new people. I believe that exploring the city and being open to new experiences can lead to meaningful connections. It's important to remember that human connection is essential for our well-being and happiness.
1943,"This lady at the store was yelling and hitting her toddler the other day when I was shopping . I was appalled at what she did ./I wanted to , but did n't know what my place would be in that scenario . It was quite maddening and off putting .","Wow, no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything?/Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement.",I would feel heartbroken and disturbed witnessing that treatment of a child. I would try to intervene or report the situation to authorities if I felt it was safe to do so. It's crucial to protect children from abuse and neglect.
1944,"I ordered pants online that I thought would fit , and they did n't !/Apparently my legs grew and I did n't notice ! I do workout four days a week ./Lol , what a bummer . What happened ?","Lol, what a bummer. What happened?/Well there you go, at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha!/Apparently my legs grew and I didn't notice! I do workout four days a week. ","Oh no, that must've been disappointing! But hey, at least it means all your hard work is paying off and your legs are getting stronger. Maybe it's time for some new pants that can show off those gains!"
1945,I was shocked to see how many hotdogs they were eating at one . This has to be a sin ... and a gigantic waste of food ./I think New York ? I was n't there personally but I saw it on TV . It was an eating contest but it was disgusting !,"Where did this happen?/Oh wow, yeah that sounds gross! I agree with the wasted food too. There are starving people all around the world!",I can't even imagine being a part of something like that. It's heartbreaking to think about the wasted food when so many are hungry. We really need to be more mindful of our consumption and the impact it has.
1946,"MY favorite restaurant was closed today ./I have no idea . I was really looking forward to a meal from there today ./Oh no , why were they closed ?","Oh no, why were they closed?/Im sorry, I know how much that stinks, like when you really really want Chickfila and its Sunday.../I have no idea. I was really looking forward to a meal from there today.",I would feel disappointed with you and understand how frustrating it can be when your favorite restaurant is unexpectedly closed. I can relate to the feeling of craving a specific meal and not being able to satisfy that craving. Maybe we can find a different place to eat together next time!
1947,"So I get bogus mail all the time including fake checks and all that jazz . Anyway , I thought one I got the other day was bogus too and left it on my counter ./Well its like work at home scams , and they want you to cash the check and send back a money order and then the check bounces leaving them with money and you in a bad situation . It actually was n't bogus . It was a $ 500 settlement check from a lawsuit against my employer from 5 years ago !",Why would you always get fake checks? That would drive me crazy./Well that was a surprise I bet.,I would feel relieved that the check was actually legitimate and not another scam. I would also feel grateful for the unexpected settlement money from the lawsuit. It must have been a pleasant surprise for you to receive it after so many years.
1948,I am afraid of airplanes ./I just do not being off the ground .,O really? Any specific reason for this fear?/Flying scares a lot of people but it's safer then driving over all.,"I understand how flying can be scary, but statistically speaking, it's actually safer than driving. Maybe focusing on the destination will help distract from the fear of being off the ground. Let's try some relaxation techniques next time you fly to help ease your nerves."
1949,I am so fortunate to have a good mother ./She always cleans and cooks for me and does my laundry .,I have to say that is a true blessing. I have a wonderful mother myself. Why do you say she is a good mom?/She sounds like a wonderful person.,I'm so glad you have such a loving and caring mother.

I thought I missef my ex but wr talk often and I definitely do n't want that headache lol/I know that can be hard .

I know there is someone out there for you, just stay positive and they will come your way!/2 years. I thought I missef my ex but wr talk often and I definitely don't want that headache lol","I'm so sorry to hear that you've been feeling lonely. It's completely normal to miss having someone around.

I do n't miss those days at all .,"Sweet, was it a difficult test?/Yea, same, it's nice to be out of school. All that learning pays off though!",I can relate to staying up late to study and the feeling of relief when it pays off with a good grade. It's definitely nice to be out of school now and enjoying the fruits of our hard work. Learning is a lifelong journey that never stops rewarding us.
1956,"Man , does n't it grind your gears when people make actual racist remarks ?/Yea , one time I met an Uncle who I had n't seen since I was a kid .

What's worse, is that they were comments about my family.","As an emotional and empathetic person, I would feel deeply hurt and angry hearing someone make racist remarks, especially if they were directed towards my family. I would probably struggle to keep my composure and would likely remove myself from the situation to avoid further confrontation. It's upsetting to see someone I once respected showing such ignorance and hate."

I'm glad you're okay physically, but I'm sorry that your ego was hurt. People can be so insensitive sometimes."
1959,"I got some bad news yesterday ... my grandmother was admitted to the hospital for cancer ./Thanks for the condolences . They are telling me it is n't severe , so I have somewhat high hopes for her eventual recovery .",Sorry for the bad news./I know she will make it.,"I'm so sorry to hear about your grandmother.

I was too afraid to move it , so I had to run it over with my car . Now it 's all over my driveway .","It probably stank a lot too./You probably should have moved with a shovel of something, instead of running over it","I would feel a wave of sadness and empathy towards the deceased possum, imagining its life coming to a tragic end.

1962,I am so annoyed at President Trump/You just mentioned.His relations with Putin.There is something fishy about it .,I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you?/I know right? Doesn't seem right. Especially with the whole Russian interference with the election.,I completely understand why you're feeling annoyed about this. His handling of relations with Russia does seem suspicious and concerning. It's important to stay informed and vocal about these issues.

They need to get back on a schedule./I think mine have two weeks left.,"I completely understand how you feel. It can be difficult when routines are disrupted.

She is the worst sometimes.,"I would feel concerned and saddened to hear someone in my conversation speaking about their daughter in such negative terms.

I would be furious!,That kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable and disrespectful. I would feel so angry and frustrated to see someone taking advantage of someone vulnerable like that. I would definitely make sure to address the situation and protect my loved one.
2048,My grandmother passed away last thanksgiving . It is tought without her ./It will . She was an awesome lady ./Im very sorry to hear that . hopefully it will get better with time .,Im very sorry to hear that. hopefully it will get better with time./Im sure she is in a better place. Looking down on you./It will. She was an awesome lady.,I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a loved one is never easy. I hope you find comfort in your memories of her.

I really hope I get it .,I hope you do well. What do you think?/Does the job come with more pay?/Good luck to you!,I would feel happy for the person and wish them luck in their evaluation. I would also feel hopeful that their hard work will pay off with a promotion and a raise. It's great to hear that they have been receiving positive feedback from their boss.
2050,I have people who litter on my property constantly and throw their beer bottles and food trash- Not just kids .. but older men . Drives me nuts/We are in a town where police do not even come for gun shots . They definitely would not come for that lol/I am setting up a camera soon but no I have never caught them . I just see teens and men walking a lot . Clearly men would have the beer lol . If I caught them I would shoot them with a paintball gun .,Do you ever try to call the police?/Well do you try to catch them lol? Thats insane We have a dog poop problem at my apartments/I would just throw the bottles back at them,I would feel frustrated and upset that people continue to disrespect my property. I would try to find a solution to catch them in the act and hold them accountable. But resorting to violence like shooting them with a paintball gun is not the answer.
2051,"I really hate when I do work at work and I see non of my coworkers working ./Yes the bosses love them . They get all the praise ./Oh yes , I bet the bosses love them too right ? That happens a lot . Very unfair","Oh yes, I bet the bosses love them too right? That happens a lot. Very unfair/Oh geez- work on your side hustle and get out of there. I did a long time ago. Hate those jobs!/Yes the bosses love them. They get all the praise.",I would feel frustrated and disheartened hearing that my coworkers are slacking off while I work hard. It's unfair that they receive praise while I put in all the effort. I would probably start looking for a new job where my hard work is truly appreciated.
2052,Im so happy my children were born healthy ./That 's good . I ca n't imagine what some parents have to go through . No child deserves to be sick ./Hopefully we can cure some of these things so no child has to go through it ./You are very lucky .

I am always so sad when I see all of these sick children on tv./I would be so happy if they could find a cure for cancer./That's good. I can't imagine what some parents have to go through. No child deserves to be sick.,"I feel grateful and blessed that my children were born healthy. It breaks my heart to think about parents who have to watch their children suffer from illnesses. I hope we can find cures for all diseases, especially cancer, so no child has to endure unnecessary pain."
2053,My daughter is such a hard worker . She goes to high school and works full time ./She is doing great . She also makes really good grades and is on the National Honor Society .,Wow. Can she handle all of that?/Thats awesome. She will do great in college.,"I would feel proud of their daughter's achievements and amazed at her dedication. It must be tough to balance school and work, but she seems to be excelling in both. I would offer my support and encouragement for her future success in college."
2054,"I was so excited and happy after my wood glue and toothpick trick worked , and it held the screw !/Yes it was , and so far the screw is holding up . - )/Absolutely , my first two attempts did not work so well so this was a super pleasant surprise !","That sounds awesome!/I'm glad that worked out for you, it could have gone in a completely different way./Yay you!

He accidentally took my car keys with him to work and when I called him to ask , he said he had an important meeting and could not bring them right away .","Oh no, I hope it was for a good reason/Oh man! It's hard when those accidents happen.","I would feel frustrated and disappointed that my husband's mistake caused me to be late for work. I would empathize with him having an important meeting, but I would also expect him to prioritize my needs in that situation. Overall, I would try to communicate openly with him about the impact of his actions on my day."

I went for business management,"was? that almost makes it sound like you didnt graduate or something went wrong, did you graduate?/Nope, unfortunately not, i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out. What did you study? /medicine and/or nursing, initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror, some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that. What can one use a business management degree for? Do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work?","I would respond by saying that with a business management degree, you can work in various industries as a manager, overseeing operations and contributing to the success of a business. Many graduates go on to work in fields such as marketing, finance, human resources, and entrepreneurship. It's a versatile degree that offers many career opportunities."
2061,"I applied for a job online and I did n't get approved ./You know , I did n't think about that . You have a good point ./Oh no , Im so sorry !

People tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead. /You know, I didn't think about that. You have a good point.",I understand how disappointing it can be to not get approved for a job you applied for. It's important to remember that it's not a reflection on your abilities or worth as a person. Just keep pushing forward and something better will come along.
2062,"Since last year hurricane Irma hit my area pretty hard . Before the peak of hurricane season this year I have already gotten extra tanks for my grill , a small generator and a weather radio just in case ./Last year , yes it was too late , there was no gas left in town or bottled water and certainly no generators when everyone was looking around a week before it hit here . I wont find myself in that predicament again !","Sorry to hear that. Did you have trouble getting the extra precautions?/Well, I hope everything turns out okay for you.",I am so sorry to hear that you went through such a difficult time last year with Hurricane Irma.

2064,"always wanted that tire but never had money to buy it , finally got it/:690 $ for four/How much was it ?","How much was it?/Wow, that's a lot, what type of vehicle?/690$ for four","I would likely respond with excitement and understanding, saying ""That's amazing! I'm so happy you were able to finally get what you've always wanted."" I might then follow up with a question like ""What make and model is your vehicle?"" to show my genuine interest in their new purchase. Finally, I'd probably express sympathy about the cost, saying something like ""Wow, that is a bit pricey. But it sounds like it was worth it for you."""

So cute ./:12 , so cute to watch the mother count them all the time to see if they are all still there ./how many of them were tehre","how many of them were tehre/What color were they ?/12, so cute to watch the mother count them all the time to see if they are all still there.","I would feel a warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart hearing about the baby ducks in the creek.

2066,i gave him $ 34 to get me the Angel Soft toiletpaper 2 huge packs and he used the money to change his oil in the car/I would not mind but my kids would,"Well, transportation is very important.  take some old clothing and cut it up if you have to ./Tissue is so expensive, it's unbelievable","I would feel frustrated and betrayed by his decision to use the money for something other than what was agreed upon. I would suggest finding a different way to obtain the toiletpaper, even if it means cutting costs in other areas. It's important to prioritize and stick to decisions, especially when it comes to providing for my family."
2067,"I find queuing at the supermarket very frustrating/Not really very long , but it 's the other people who annoy me !/I do as well , how long does it take you to do it ?","I do as well, how long does it take you to do it?/that makes sense, but I guess everyone needs food!/Not really very long, but it's the other people who annoy me!","I totally understand how frustrating it can be to deal with other people in line, but I try to stay patient and remind myself that everyone is just trying to get their groceries. I generally try to distract myself with my phone or a book while waiting, it helps to pass the time. Hang in there, we're all in this together!"
2068,"I was angry when the Eagles lost the superbowl in 2004 . I was young but I was still mad/They were playing the Patriots , it was a very close game",Yeah? Who were they playing against?/I think I remember watching it. How old were you then?,I would sympathize with the speaker's frustration at losing such an important game. I might share my own experiences of being upset when my favorite team lost a big game. I would comfort them by acknowledging that it's completely normal to be angry about something that meant so much to them at the time.
2069,"I get sentimental thinking about all the great times I had as a child on my street growing up/Yeah , that is for sure , I had a lot of great times there , so many memories","It's a boon for everyone. Great life period is childhood./Yeah, whenever I miss my childhood I try to spend the time with the kids. So we can feel better.",That conversation brings back so much nostalgia for me too. I can completely relate to wanting to recreate those happy memories by spending time with kids. Childhood is truly a precious time that shapes who we are.
2070,"The football fever ended finally . But I expect a win from Croatia ./Yeah , I just waiting for that curiously .","I know, but now we have another kind of football season coming up soon/Me too, I am so excited, since the Eagles just won last year!","I would respond by saying, ""I can understand why you're excited for the next football season. It's always fun to see your favorite team do well. Hopefully Croatia can come out on top next time!"""

I love soul food, it always brings back fond memories. Maybe we can try it together sometime, it sounds delicious."
2073,MY son woke up at the crack of dawn this morning/He is so spoiled . He just couldnt lay in the bed with me . He had to roll around and pull my hair and things so I would get up too .

Im sure he will want a nap later. Hopefully that gives you time to recharge a little./He is so spoiled. He just couldnt lay in the bed with me. He had to roll around and pull my hair and things so I would get up too. He is 3,"I totally understand how exhausting it can be when kids wake up early, especially during summer vacation. Maybe a nap for both of you would be a good idea later. Hang in there, I hope you get some time to rest and recharge soon."
2074,I cant stop thinking about my grandmother . She passed away recently and it hurts to think about ./Im sure it will get better with time . I used to see her everyday for lunch . I miss those times .,I'm sorry to hear that. I lost mine recently also./That must be hard. ,I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I understand how painful it can be to lose someone you have such a close bond with. Take your time to grieve and remember the special moments you shared with your grandmother.
2075,"School is about to start back . I think I 'm gon na miss having my kids at home/Yep . I will be alone at home , but if I get them all on good schedules I will find a part time job ./I know that feeling , that is no fun , but at least they are learning !","I know that feeling, that is no fun, but at least they are learning!/That is good, that is a nice way to make a bit of extra money!/Yep. I will be alone at home, but if I get them all on good schedules I will find a part time job.","I understand how you feel about missing having your kids at home, it can be a big adjustment. But finding a part-time job could be a great way to keep yourself busy and active. And while they may be away at school, they will still be learning and growing, which is important."
2076,"I was sad when my grandmother passed away , that was not a good time in my life/I did , we were very close , it really hit me hard",I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you spend a lot of time with her?/That's terrible.  I hope she's at least at peace now.,I'm so sorry for your loss. It must have been tough to lose such an important person in your life. I hope you can find some peace and comfort in the memories you shared together.

May be too late now since you are older , but back then it was my life haha",I never really got into pokemon./I tried to do the mobile game but I didn't get it lol,"I completely understand the nostalgia you feel for the old Pokemon games.

2078,I got lucky and hit on a lotto scratcher ./A cool $ 100 . I needed it too ./Oh really ? How much did you win ?,"Oh really?

2079,"I get sentimental about my family sometimes , I just really love them a lot/Our immediate familyis just 5 people",Really? Have you got a large family?/But you are all very close knit then?,"I would likely respond by saying, ""That's so sweet, family really is everything. Even though my family is small too, we have a really strong bond. It's amazing to have such a close-knit support system."""
2080,"Speaking of family , I love reading to my little neice ./Yeah - I think it 's because you know that they will learn to do it within a couple of years but whilst they are learning they are trying to discover it for themselves .","That must be fun, it is so cute watching kids try to read books for some reason/Yeah, kids are just so adorable, watching them learn in front of your eyes is an awesome privelege ",That sounds like such a special bonding experience with your niece. I can only imagine how heartwarming it must be to witness her learning and growing through reading. Being able to be a part of her journey must bring you so much joy and fulfillment.
2081,I just graduated college and I couldnt be happier . It was a huge accomplishment . Neither of my parents went to college ./Finance . I feel so accomplished .

That may ruin the walls./Hopefully she learns her lesson. /I know! I told her I need to approve of all decorations. I am so mad.,"I would feel empathy for the parent's frustration at the potential wall damage and understand their desire for final say in decorations. I would also feel sadness for the daughter possibly facing consequences for her actions. I would suggest finding a compromise where the parent still has final approval, but the daughter can participate in decorating her space."

I'm excited and a little bit unexcited. Will be good to have a schedule, but worried about being able to do school and earn money to pay rent. What are you majoring in?/Hey, that's pretty cool!

I have gotten the hang of the work/school/mom balance so I think it's going to go great","I can totally relate to feeling excited and a little anxious about the upcoming semester.

2088,"just once was i late with my payment and they charged me 39 bucks , i hate visa/they would not even do a courtesy waive","That is obnoxious, I would switch just to stick it to them/that is terrible, that is not a good way to keep people",I would feel frustrated and disappointed hearing about your experience with Visa. It's unfair that they wouldn't even waive the fee for being late once. I would definitely consider switching credit card companies as well.

I have broken up with mine after 3 years of being together/It was her who initiated the first move for us to split our ways.

She does not deserve such treatment from me","I would be more than jealous, but maybe I am not super sane about that kind of thing/That is probably true, but the stories we hear do not help",I would try to put myself in your shoes and understand your feelings of jealousy. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about these emotions. It's also important to trust in the relationship and work on building that trust together.
2091,"I was devestated when I lost my grandmother , we were very close/Not super recently , but a few years ago , but it still hurts",I'm sorry to hear that. Did she pass away recently?/Yeah.

2093,"I was afraid when my dad used to scare me and my brothers/No he was just playing tricks I suppose , but still","Was he just playing tricks on you, to get you to laugh? Or was he being malicious about it? /Yeah, sometimes dads forget how young kids are and just do what they think is funny. My dad wasn't the best either at understanding how fragile kids can be. But he was still a good da","I can understand how that would have been scary for you and your brothers. It's tough when parents don't realize the impact their actions can have on their children. Even if it was meant to be playful, it's important to think about how it could be perceived by young ones."
2094,"Was n't able to register for one of the classes I need to be on track to graduate in my last year of college . Have to contact the school and see if they 'll be able to make an exception and squeeze me into a full class , or I do n't know what I 'll do ./Truthfully , it was my fault .

Good luck with contacting the school, I hope they are able to make an exception for you."
2095,"I am ashamed that i used to be scared of the dark , I always had a nightlight/I get that , I still felt bad at the time","Nothing wrong with that, it's the unknown that scares us all./I'd try not to be too down on myself over it.","I completely understand how you feel, I used to be scared of the dark too.

2097,"I am grateful for my family , they mean a lot to me even if they are not perfect by any stretch/That is for sure , it really rings true","i agree on all terms, without family we dont mean much in the world/of course","I completely resonate with that sentiment. Family is everything to me, imperfections and all. They provide meaning and purpose in my life, and I am truly fortunate to have them by my side."
2098,"i should stop paying them , they do not prepare my lawn right for me/they come and spend 15 minutes and leave","That is not cool, I would cancel immediately/Oh, yeah you should definitely cancel in that case",I would feel frustrated and upset hearing that someone was not being treated properly. I would understand why they would want to cancel if they were not getting the service they were paying for. I would offer my support and suggest finding a more reliable provider.
2099,My son was in an away soccer tournament when his cleats broke ! I had an extra pair in the trunk though ./No but they would n't let him off the field because it was n't time to sub ! He kept falling !,That's lucky!  Did he get hurt from his shoes breaking mid game?/Oh no!  I hope it didn't effect his team too much.,"I would feel so bad for the poor kid struggling to play with broken cleats. I would be relieved to hear that he didn't get hurt, but still concerned about his performance and the impact on his team. I would hope for a quick resolution and a better outcome for the rest of the tournament."

She was tied up in over 100 degree weather- no water , filthy , way overbred and starved ./I was terrified for a moment as it was back in the woods where some sketchy people hang out at night and live- but I grabbed her from that rope and I hid her for a few days until I found a rescue .

I 'm not gon na do anything with it , but someone else could easily just walk off with it .","Woah, did she say she was coming back? She's awfully trusting./Totally, and I bet most people would walk off with it. I have no faith in humanity.","I would feel a mixture of sympathy for the person leaving their phone and concern for their safety. It's sad that we live in a world where trust is often exploited, and it's a reminder to always be cautious. I hope that the girl gets her phone back safely and that she doesn't have to worry about losing it again in the future."
2216,Its meet the teacher day at the school . I always get nervous doing this ./Im the parent . I always feel like I do n't belong around other parents because they are always much older ./Are you the parent or the teacher ? I get nervous meeting anyone new,Are you the parent or the teacher? I get nervous meeting anyone new/I felt like that when my kids were younger. Doesn't feel like that now they're teenagers. It'll be ok just act natural/Im the parent. I always feel like I don't belong around other parents because they are always much older.,"I completely understand how you feel. It can be intimidating being around people who seem different from us. Just remember, everyone is there for the same reason - to support their children. Take a deep breath and just be yourself, you'll do great!"
2217,"My friend fell during a race , and everyone in the race stopped to help her ./Yea , it 's been rescheduled .",That was nice. IDid they have to start it over?/Did she hurt herself?,I would feel so touched by how everyone came together to help my friend during a difficult moment.

2218,"Everything is falling into place for me ./My job is good . Kids are doing great in school , and I 'm saving for a down payment on a house ./That 's great to hear . What 's going on ?","That's great to hear. What's going on?/That sounds really great. Happy for ya./My job is good. Kids are doing great in school, and I'm saving for a down payment on a house.

That's a great accomplishment. I hope to buy a house soon./I don't stretch myself too thin. I know I'm far from rich.,That must be such a relief for you. I understand the importance of not overextending yourself financially. It's great that you're being mindful of your own situation.
2220,"I missed work to go to court the other day ./Continuance . For the 5th time . I so tired of it ./Oh no , that sucks . What happened at court ?","Oh no, that sucks.

This is such a great place to work at .",That was so nice of them to do such a thing./I bet it is. When things like that happen it makes you really value where you work. Makes it enjoyable.,I would feel touched and grateful seeing everyone come together to help their coworker. It's heartwarming to witness such kindness and support in the workplace. It's moments like these that make me appreciate where I work even more.
2222,I remember a time when I actually had my entire family together for the holidays . It was really nice/We have five kids and his mother . Other than the kids I do n't have much family . Our oldest kids are in college . Hard to meet up now .,Do you guys not get together often anymore?/You all can still spend time together separately even if you can't all be together. Have to make it work.,"I can only imagine how difficult it must be not being able to have your whole family together for the holidays. It's important to cherish the time you do have together, even if it's not all at once. It's true that you can still make meaningful connections with each family member individually, even if you can't all be together physically."
2223,"I think my life is going pretty decent compared to the past ./Nothing bad in a long time is all . I am so used to bad news . Things are just working out ./That 's great to hear ! If you do n't mind me asking , what happened ?","That's great to hear! If you don't mind me asking, what happened?/Still, that's still great. You better knock on some wood though, just in case.

It's nice to see that their luck has turned around after a streak of bad news. I would probably offer some encouraging words to keep up the positive momentum.

At least you made it./Three hours though. I don't think I would've made it.,"I would feel relieved and sympathetic towards the person's situation, imagining how uncomfortable and stressful it must have been to hold it for three hours. I would commend them for making it to the bathroom in time and express understanding of how overwhelming work can be at times. I would also likely share a similar experience to make them feel less alone in their struggle."
2225,My neighbors are the worst ./They have guests constantly and are always slamming doors . It 's terrible ./Oh no . what happened ?,Oh no. what happened?/If only people were more considerate of others. It's not just them in the world./They have guests constantly and are always slamming doors. It's terrible.,I would feel frustrated and upset for my neighbor's poor treatment. I would try to offer support and suggest talking to them about how the noise is affecting their well-being. Empathy for their situation would guide my response in finding a solution for both parties.
2226,"I spend a lot of time looking at my kds baby photos ./three , four and thirteen . And they are all terrible lol jk/Are they grown up now ? They grow up so fast .","Are they grown up now? They grow up so fast./hahaha I bet there are./three, four and thirteen. And they are all terrible lol jk","I would smile and say, ""I bet those baby photos are adorable! Time really does fly by when they're growing up, doesn't it?"" 
I would empathize, ""It must be bittersweet to see them all grown up now, even though they're still terrible teens.""

I've never been camping./I would be afraid of animals and bugs I think.,"I completely understand your fear of animals and bugs while camping.

I wish I lived a couple miles away from one ./That happens sometimes . Maybe next year .,That happens sometimes. Maybe next year./I took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if that's where we are going. /Well it's 9 hours away so we probably won't go until next year either lol/I hope. How has your summer been so far?,"I feel for you, it's tough when unexpected expenses come up and your plans have to be put on hold. It sounds like your kids had a great time at the beach though, that must have been special. My summer has been pretty relaxed so far, just enjoying the warm weather and spending time with loved ones."
2229,"I once left my wallet on a bench outside of the airport ./I did n't . I was planning to buy my first car the next day and had my down payment in there too . $ 2000 .

2230,I found a snake a few days ago while walking in the yard ./It startled me quite a bit ./i killed it,OMG.

I get the good stuff for my friends ./Well , you 're popular then at least .","Well, you're popular then at least./that actually makes sense to me./funny thing is, at family functions I buy cheap beer. I get the good stuff for my friends.",I would feel touched by the speaker's generosity towards their friends and understand their desire to make those close to them feel special. It shows a lot about their character and the value they place on their relationships. I would appreciate their thoughtfulness and consider them a great friend to have.
2232,"I put lipstick on before going into the grocery store the other day and when I got back in my car , I looked in the rear view mirror and my teeth were that bright red color .

It looked like blood . lol/Did you notice any funny glances from anyone ?",Did you notice any funny glances from anyone?/Did you taste anything funny from the lipstick?/It would have been more of a shocked look I think. It looked like blood. lol,"I would feel embarrassed and self-conscious if that happened to me, I can imagine how you must have felt. It sounds like a funny and awkward situation, but at least you can laugh about it now. Next time, maybe I'll suggest checking in a mirror before leaving the house just to be safe!"

I feel great now though.","I'm so sorry you had to go through that, it must have been really tough. But I'm glad to hear you're feeling better now and ready to start dating again. You deserve someone who appreciates you and treats you right."
2234,"I think there is a mouse in my kitchen . I keep hearing squeaking noises at night ./I 'm too afraid to go in there . Luckily I have a door to the kitchen . Otherwise I 'd just leave the apartment ./probably , time to get the traps and get rid of it .","probably, time to get the traps and get rid of it./going to have to do something...call somebody to help you./I'm too afraid to go in there. Luckily I have a door to the kitchen. Otherwise I'd just leave the apartment.",I would feel sorry for the person dealing with the mouse issue and offer to help them set up the traps.

And the work is so repetitive ./Why have you been lazy ?,Why have you been lazy?/What kind of work is it?/Trying to get school things together. I've just been tired. And the work is so repetitive.,"I would respond by saying, ""I completely understand how school can be exhausting and overwhelming. Maybe taking breaks and prioritizing tasks can help.

Overall, I would react positively and supportive to their anticipation of the upcoming school year."
2238,MY friend texted to come over the othe day and I lied and said I was n't home ./She wanted to bring her kids too and I just was n't feeling it . I feel terrible . I like her kids/Yeah . That 's what I should have done ./She is . I 'm going to invite her over tomorrow and cook .,"Hope they don't find out.  Were you just tired or something else?/Well, next time try telling her the truth, like , I am too tired right now, can we do it another day. and that way you won't feel bad./I'm sure she would understand if she is a good friend./I bet it will be a good dinner, since there is some guilt involved. lol",I completely understand the feeling of guilt. It's never easy to admit when we're not feeling up for something. But I think your friend will appreciate your honesty and understanding. Just remember to be kind to yourself and communicate openly next time.
2239,"Finally got some yard work done last weekend . The grass was getting out of control and if it 's too high , you ca n't hardly cut it ./I would like to concrete three quarters of the yard ./That 's true .

The Buick Enclave is a beautiful and luxurious choice."
2241,Do n't you hate it when your broke friends complain about being broke ... then drop $ 100 at the club like nothing ? It 's the dumbest thing ever/Then go to work and post on Facebook about how much they hate their boss ... like get your life together buddy haha,I really hate that!/Some people are so petty.,I would feel a mix of disappointment and frustration towards the person making those comments. It shows a lack of understanding and empathy towards those who may be struggling financially or have difficult work situations. I would try to gently educate them on the importance of being more compassionate and supportive towards others.
2242,":5 years in my apartment and I have always gotten terrible neighbors ./That 's the crazy thing . I just got new neighbors last week and they are a dream . Quiet , respectful , no kids .

I 'm waiting for them to get home now .",I dread that it will go so quickly!/What do you do during the day?,I completely understand that feeling of time passing too quickly. I spend my days trying to cherish every moment with my kids while they are still young. My main focus and priority is always ensuring their safety and well-being.

2294,I felt bad when I lied to my cousin . I mad up an excuse when I missed his wedding/I was hungover and sick,"Dang, that's kinda hurtful. Why did you miss the wedding?/I've had those days before. I would just take it as a lesson and try to control your drinking next time when important events are in the near future.",I would feel guilty for lying and hurting my cousin.

I never did that before and I was so ashamed .,"That seems like a lot of pizza rolls, how do you feel?/Hey, we all pig out at some point","I'm so sorry you're feeling so ashamed about eating all those pizza rolls at once.

Not sure what to do .",Did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back?/I understand.,"I would feel guilty and conflicted about keeping the money, knowing it belonged to someone else.

It's too bad you lost it all on more tickets, but at least it was a fun moment of excitement. Maybe next time just stick with that one winning ticket and treat yourself to a nice meal!"
2329,"Yesterday I got into a scrap with a homeless man over a half eaten sandwich ./No , but I was terribly hungry , since I did n't go grocery shopping . I felt so bad .","Are you homeless?/Lol, I bet that a good looking sandwich then.",I would feel empathy for both the homeless man and the person who didn't have groceries. It's hard to see people struggle for food when we have so much. I hope both are able to find proper nourishment soon.
2330,I need a tooth pulled and I am scared to go to the dentist . SCARED ! @ # ! @/I ca n't stop thinking about it . I am terrified !,"Oh, you will probably be just fine don't worry about it too much./Dentist aren't people focused on trying to hurt you.","I understand how nerve-wracking it can be to go to the dentist. It's completely normal to feel scared about a dental procedure. Remember, the dentist's main goal is to help you feel better, not to cause you pain."
2331,So i do some silly things at time and i feel bad at times . I went to a buffet by myself ./I ate so much food and i was like a pig but i feel it was worth it . The weight gain though was n't .,Ut oh.. What did you eat?/Don't worry... you only live once!,"I would respond by expressing empathy for feeling bad about overeating, but also offer support and reassurance that it's okay to indulge once in a while. I would acknowledge the guilt of weight gain but also remind them that self-care and self-compassion are important too. I would end by saying that it's all about finding a balance and enjoying life responsibly."
2332,I always get nervous when I drive . The possibility of getting into a car accident is nerve wrecking ./I think it has to do with seeing a lot of car accidents when I was little .,"I hate driving, I avoid it as much as possible. /Mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.",I am so sorry to hear that driving brings up such deep-seated fear for you. It must be incredibly challenging to carry those memories with you whenever you're behind the wheel. Your feelings are valid and it's important to prioritize your emotional well-being.
2333,I thanks God for my wife ./Because of the person she is .,Thats good to hear. Why do you thank god for her?/Well thats nice. I thank god for my wife as well,I would feel happy and touched by the genuine love and appreciation shown towards their wife. It warms my heart to see someone so grateful for their partner's presence in their life. It reinforces the importance of expressing gratitude for loved ones.

My last date was in high school , I 'm so alone .../Thank you , maybe I need to learn to love myself first",Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me./That is also very important to learn.,"I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling lonely. Everyone deserves love and companionship, and I truly believe that things will get better for you.

2335,"When my grandmother died i kind of lost it a little . shut myself into my room for a while ./I do , But i never thought i would shut myself out that much .","That sucks, do you feel better now?/Yeah, isolation can happen when you get super sad. At least you are feeling better now",I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. It's completely normal to need some time alone to process your feelings. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better now.
2336,"I did n't have high expectations for this new restaurant in town but my friend and I had dinner there last week and it was better than I thought it would be !/It was seafood and no , they were n't . Usually the restaurants in that particular building do n't last long at all .","That's always a positive in my book, what kind of food was it?  What were your reservations about the restaurant before going?/Is it in a bad part of town or is the building just bad luck or run down?","I would respond by saying, ""I'm so glad you had a positive experience at the restaurant! I love hearing success stories like that. I hope the trend continues for them in the future!"""
2337,"My coworker told my boss that I came in to work 15 minutes late this morning . I could n't believe he did that to me !/Yeah , I could't understand why he would throw me under the bus like that .","I am sorry, that sounds bad/Maybe it wont happen again",I would feel hurt and betrayed by my coworker's actions. I would also feel vulnerable and exposed. I hope that my coworker learns from this and doesn't do it again in the future.
2338,"My zipper was down at work all day . I will not live that down/It was , I am still sad about it",Oh my gosh!  That must have been so embarrassing!/Don't worry.  I'm sure you will never make that mistake again!,"Oh no, I'm sorry that happened to you. I can only imagine how mortifying that must have been. But just remember, we all make mistakes and it'll pass with time."
2339,"My best friend was sending her daughter on a plane to stay with me for a couple weeks . She told me she could n't come along because the tickets were too expensive ./Actually , when I went to the airport to pickup her daughter , they both walked out of the gate together ! She found a way to get the ticket after all .","Aw, that sucks because money was the issue. Maybe she can take a bus or something?/Yay! I love happy endings",I would feel relieved and happy knowing that my friend found a way to be with her daughter. It's heartwarming to see them reunited at the airport. I would hug them both tightly and celebrate their happy ending together.
2340,"I think I saw someone die today , I was so frightened ./I was driving and saw a big accident on the side of the road . As I drove by , I think I saw a dead person ...",Oh how scary! What happened?/I am so sorry you had to see that. That is so bad. Did you have to call it in?,"I would immediately feel a sense of sadness and sympathy for the person who witnessed such a traumatic event. I would offer comfort and reassurance, acknowledging the gravity of the situation. I would ask if they needed someone to talk to or if there was anything I could do to support them."
2341,My wife up and left me last year/No one knows and she will not tell me ./Ouch ! that stinks man why she do it ?,"Ouch! that stinks man why she do it?/That is even worse, Like why would someone just do that when commited to someone./No one knows and she will not tell me.","I would offer my sincere condolences and tell the person that I am here to listen and support them during this difficult time.

I would encourage them to seek closure and healing, and to focus on taking care of themselves."
2342,So i wanted a party when i was little for my 7th birthday i think ./Yeah but this one was n't planned with me involved heck i did n't know it was happening til i opened my front door .,Parties are some times very loud./If my friends did that I would have a heart attack.,"That must have been so overwhelming to have such a surprise party thrown for you without any input. I can imagine feeling a mix of emotions and not knowing how to react in the moment. It's important for friends to consider how their actions might impact others, especially in situations that can be distressing like unexpected surprises."
2343,"I was let down by the movie . I was expecting much more ./The new tomb raider movie , it was so bad ...",What movie are you referring too?/Oh! Well i haven't seen that yet. was the action at least somewhat decent?,"I would likely empathize with their disappointment and offer my own experiences with movies that didn't live up to my expectations. I might also ask for more details about why they disliked the movie so much, as I'm curious and enjoy discussing film opinions. Lastly, I would express appreciation for their honesty and sharing their thoughts with me."
2344,You know when you start something and you do n't really see results til years later ./Well i played soccer for 8 years and now just finally scored a goal .,"Yeah I hate waiting for the results of a long term goal/Damn, you suck at soccer. Just kidding, good job!! lol",I would feel excited and proud for the person finally achieving their goal after so many years of hard work. I would congratulate them and show my support by acknowledging their accomplishment. It's important to celebrate even the smallest victories along the journey to achieving our long-term goals.
2345,I felt bad when I lied to my dad . I just felt bad about getting in trouble/I got in trouble and was afraid to tell him,Oh no.. what happened?  Are you ok?/What did you lie to him about?,"I would respond by saying, ""I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling guilty about lying to your dad.

2347,My boyfriend is making me so mad right now . He is on like beer 15/I dont know . He is so dumb when he drinks .,"Wow, why does he need to drink so much?/I'm sorry, I've dealt with something like that before and it can be very anger inducing.",I would feel empathy for you and understand why you are feeling frustrated. It's important to communicate your concerns with your boyfriend and address his excessive drinking. Remember to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being in this situation.
2348,"I lied to my friend about hanging out with someone she really hates , I feel bad about it ./No , but this person spread a nasty rumour about my friend .",Did you do anything wrong?/Oh.. thats horrible.  I am so sorry.,I would feel guilty for lying to my friend and may try to make it up to them. I would also be angry at the person spreading rumors about my friend. I would offer my empathy and support to my friend during this difficult time.
2349,"I hate being alone at my house , it 's not fulfilling at all ./I usually like being by myself but it 's taking a toll on my social life now","Myself as well, friends are what make life better./Alone time is important but you will go crazy if you are always alone.","I completely understand how you feel.

2350,"Last year , late at night someone stole my phone ./It was my flip phone , it was the only one that I had ./Was it a smartphone ? Maybe you can track it ?","Was it a smartphone? Maybe you can track it ?/Aw, that sucks. Did you get a new phone?/It was my flip phone, it was the only one that I had.","Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened to you.

2352,Seeing expensive cars on the road is always inspiring . I am usually in awe because I know it takes hard work to get those !/I like big SUVs like Range Rovers and Jeeps,What kind of cars do you like the best?/Range Rovers are my favorite too. If you work hard you can get one!,"Seeing expensive cars on the road always brings me mixed emotions- a mix of admiration and a tinge of envy. I appreciate the hard work and dedication it must have taken to afford such luxury. Personally, my dream car would be a Tesla- sleek, environmentally friendly, and definitely a symbol of success."
2353,I miss my aunt . I wish she was still here/It was 10 years ago,When did she pass away?/Well have you been living a happy life? She would probably be happy about that.,"I'm sorry for your loss, I can only imagine how much you miss her. It's beautiful to think about how proud she would be of you living a happy life. Cherish the memories and keep her spirit alive in your heart."
2354,So i am really happy now that i have a new girlfriend ./It 's not easy finding someone with the same interest as you .,"I am sure she is happy too/It can be hard, but its possible","I'm so happy for you! It must feel amazing to find someone who shares your interests and makes you feel so fulfilled. Relationships can be tough to find, but when you do, it's truly magical."
2355,Those dang neighborhood kids keep egging my car !/I do n't but it sucks cleaning my car off ! It 's gross and smells awful !,Do you have cameras?/I know right? It's even more worse when it's hot outside and it cooks to your car so it's harder to clean up,I would feel frustrated and sorry for them about their car being egged. I would suggest getting cameras to catch the culprits in the act. I would also offer to help them clean off the mess.
2356,"I get very depressed seeing roadkill when driving . Such a sad way to go ./Yes , I saw one this morning . It was rotting and crows were feeding on it , so sad ...","Have you seen any recently? It is really sad, what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit./Poor thing, it's not fair! Drivers need to watch out!",I would feel heartbroken and empathetic hearing about roadkill.

I hate being lost in general,"Oh wow, that sounds really scary. I can't imagine how terrifying it must have been for you. I hope you were able to find your way back home safely."
2359,"My brother , dumped out all of my cards on the floor ./i cried for a few days afterwards",Oh man that stinks. What did you do in response?/Did he ever apologize?,I would feel hurt and devastated by the lack of respect my brother showed towards me and my belongings. I may have a hard time understanding why he did it and would likely need some time to process my emotions. I would appreciate a sincere apology from him to help start the healing process.

But it was a long time of stress and fun atleast .,What journey?  Do tell./Oh Congratulations...  That is a huge accomplishment!,That must have been quite a challenging yet rewarding journey.

What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money?/I'm so sorry, you should see if you can find him on social media!","I can't believe your friend would do that to you, that's really messed up. I hope you're able to somehow get your money back. Maybe there's a way to track him down online and get in touch with him."
2365,THe worst thing happened the other day . I went grovery shopping and I thought I was being followed . It scared me so bad !/This big scary guy,Who was following you?!/What did he look like?

I am so happy it does but one game wasn't working sadly.,"I would feel nostalgic and excited hearing about the Nintendo 64.

I just heard a really crazy sounding animal coming from my lake out back of my house ./Im in Florida .. it could be ANYTHING lol .,Oh snap! dude get your camera you might have found nessy./Probably could be a new species of gator.,"I would feel anxious and worried for their safety, imagining all the possible dangerous scenarios that could be happening.

It's understandable to feel guilty about not cleaning it up right away. Your concern for the trashman's job and your remorse for not picking up the mess show that you have a good heart.
2370,"You know , I find it difficult to respond to certain situations . Like when my friend 's dog died , I just did n't know what to say to him ./Yea , exactly .

2371,"I laughed at this lady who fell over in the grocery store today . I 'm so disappointed in myself for doing that ./That 's true , maybe I should n't be so hard on myself .",Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate./At least you recognize that it may not have been appropriate. ,I would feel guilty for finding humor in someone else's misfortune and would empathize with the woman who fell. I would reassure the person that recognizing the behavior was inappropriate is a positive step towards becoming more empathetic. I would encourage them to forgive themselves and strive to react with more kindness and understanding in the future.

He corrected me and I felt about 2 inches tall !",Did you punch him in the nose?/This is why i got rid of all of my friends.,I would feel really embarrassed for calling my friend by the wrong name in front of my daughter. I can empathize with the feeling of shrinking in humiliation. It's moments like these that make me appreciate the importance of genuine connections and understanding in friendships.
2376,"My sister graduated college last week ./No , I punched her right in the nose like we do here ! It 's a tradition .",Ah - that's a big accomplishment!!!  Did you get her a great present?/HAHA!  That is the best tradition I've ever heard of!,"I would be horrified by the mention of violence towards someone, especially a family member.

So its been awhile since I was the new person .,"Oh man, I know the nerves can be rough, but I'm sure you're excited as well. But yea, throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough./Oh wow. Well, I really hope you enjoy the new job! I have a feeling you'll do just fine.","I can understand how it must be nerve-wracking to start a new job after being in the same place for so long. Just remember, everyone was new at some point. I'm sure you'll do great and make some new friends in no time!"
2378,"Man , do n't you hate when you have a test coming up and you procrastinate studying ?/Hahaha , well , this is a pretty good use of your time as well though !

2379,So i was exploring some abandon buildings one day ./Nah but something i feel found me . Started hearing banging on the walls and crawling in the other rooms .,"Did you find anything interesting inside any of the buildings?/Oh man, I would have freaked out! What did you do?",I would have been terrified in that situation. I probably would have run out of there as fast as I could. It sounds like a really scary experience.

I was afraid he was going to go to jail ./I hope he learned his lesson . He does n't remember anything from the night .,"As someone who was once a 19 year old man, don't be too shocked./Yikes he's one of the zombie drunks.   That's unfortunate.  Drinking might not be for him./Most do. I know a guy that kind of gets blackout drunk like that.  His brother does too.  Now neither of them drink hard liquor (well they haven't for ages now)",I would feel concerned for the son and his well-being. It's heartbreaking to see someone in such a state of vulnerability. I hope he finds healthier ways to cope with whatever he's going through.
2382,I had an old pocket knife returned to me that 's ~15 years old . My cousin had it/It was pretty random . I saw it and it looked just like a pocket knife I used to have and lost .

I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him .,That's really cool. I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him./That's really interesting.

He said he found it in an old coat from ages ago and had no clue where it was from.,"Oh wow, that must have brought back a flood of memories for you. I can imagine how special it must be to have that old pocket knife back in your possession after so many years. It's great to hear stories like this that remind us of the sentimental value certain items hold."

That's good news!,"I would say, ""I'm glad to hear that it wasn't an infection! It's always scary going to the doctor for something like that. Take care of yourself and keep an eye on it just to be safe."""
2384,"My dog was my best friend , now he 's gone and I feel isolated ./No , I could n't do that .","Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting another one?/Oh I understand. They say time heals all wounds, I hope it does in your case as well.","I am so sorry to hear about your dog, it must be really difficult to be coping with his absence. Taking the time to grieve and heal is important, and I understand your hesitation in getting another one right now.

2385,I am nervous .. I have to go to court for the first time ./What if I say the wrong thing ... Or trip and fall .,"Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I have been to court before/That won't happen. Even if it does, the judge may have a good laugh and cut you some slack.","I would tell them that it's okay to be nervous, and that it's normal to feel that way before going to court. I would also reassure them that mistakes happen, and that the judge is there to be fair and understanding. Lastly, I would offer my support and let them know that I am here for them during this stressful time."

Are you nervous?/I would tell you to think of everyone in their underwear, but I am pretty sure that advice never works!",I completely understand how nerve-wracking it can be to give a major presentation. I empathize with your anxiety and hope that all your preparation pays off tomorrow. Just remember to take deep breaths and believe in yourself - you've got this!
3268,"I got off work the other day and noticed one of my tires had been slashed in the parking lot . Needless to say , not the best way to end the work day/They have not found anyone yet . What really hacks me off is our security cameras did not get a good view of the person","Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it?/Dang dude. Is your insurance company covering it at least?",I would feel really angry and frustrated for the person who had their tire slashed. I would offer my support and ask if there is anything I can do to help. It's just not fair when bad things like that happen.
3269,"I have a huge test tomorrow in Physics and I do n't feel prepared for it ./You 're right ! But no matter how much studying I may do , I know it 's going to be a tough one .",Get to studying!

3270,I accidentally overdrafted my bank account and now do n't have enough money to pay the fee or my bills . I 'm scared of what could happen/Are you sure ? I guess I will need to make some phone calls .,"I have been there, my friend. But, the good news is, if you aren't typically late for your bills, the utilities companies will often cut you a break./I am positive! I have been late before for the very same reason. Don't even need to make phone calls - they just give you a small late fee and that's it. I wouldn't go making it a habit, though.","I would feel a twinge of anxiety hearing that, remembering the stress of being in a similar situation myself. I would offer reassurance and encouragement, sharing my own experience of how utilities companies often understand and make exceptions. I would advise against making it a habit, emphasizing the importance of being proactive with finances."
3271,"So , yesterday morning , some ingrate stole my cappuccino at Starbucks ./Well , it was pretty busy , so I think he just thought it was his . Maybe we had the same name ? Anywho , all I know is is that I was far grumpier than usual .",How did that happen? I would be so upset./Did Starbucks not make you a new one? I am definitely grumpy if I don't get my morning coffee! ,"Wow, that sounds really frustrating! I can imagine how upsetting it must have been to lose your cappuccino like that. I hope the rest of your day went smoother after that mishap."

I studied so hard .",Oh well it's still fun that you got to participate in that./Haha that's really a cute story though.,I would feel empathy for the person sharing their story about losing the spelling bee in elementary school. I would feel their disappointment and frustration at not winning after studying so hard. I would try to offer words of support and encouragement to lift their spirits.
3273,I stole a soda as a teenager and got caught in the parking lot by the security people . I felt so ashamed ./Haha no she called my parents and I was banned from the store .,"Oh wow, did anything end up happening to you? Did you get 20 years in prison?/Eh, I suppose worse things could happen. Was it worth it?",I would feel sorry that you had to go through that embarrassment. Your parents must have been angry but at least it was just a temporary ban. I hope you learned from the experience and won't do it again.
3274,I felt so accomplished when I started my own business . It 's still in the beginning phase but it 's an awesome feeling ./It 's an online service business with mine and my wife 's original music therapy songs .,Great! what kind of business?/Music therapy sounds very interesting.,That's amazing!

Which is somewhat funny because it 's the word I missed when I was in my first spelling bee .,That is great. Do you remember what words he had to spell?/That is a pretty tough word. I am happy your son did so great. You must have been beaming.,"I would say, ""That's wonderful news! I can only imagine how proud you must feel. It's amazing that he conquered a word that gave you trouble in the past."""
3276,"Yesterday I was looking through my wallet and realized a bunch of money was missing . There was only one person who was near my wallet ./It was the guy I thought was my best friend . I was so devastated . I did n't care about the money , but the fact he would stead from me . (","That's a downer, man. Who do you think was the perpetrator?/That really sucks man. Did he ever apologize to you and give the money back?","I would feel hurt and betrayed by my friend's actions. I would question our friendship and wonder why he would do such a thing.

Although , I do have faith in him that he will turn it around next semester , since I am grounding him for eternity .",Oh no! Did he not study?/He will for sure get it next time.

He will learn there will be consequences for his failure to listen .",You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson./You are doing the right thing for him to learn discipline.,"I can understand your frustration, but punishing your son by taking away his video game may not teach him the desired lesson. Maybe try having a calm conversation with him about responsibility instead of jumping straight to punishment. It's important to communicate and understand each other's perspectives before resorting to disciplinary actions."
3282,I am being in fear lately/I stared to cough blood 3 days ago and I fear it must be cancer .,"Oh no! Any particular reason why?/That's horrible! But, it could be many other things instead.

Have you tried switching to cash envelopes?/Where you just use cash and put money in an envelope, when it's gone, it's gone, nothing left to spend.","I completely understand that feeling of being unable to stop spending money, it can be really overwhelming.  Switching to cash envelopes might help you stick to a budget and physically see how much you have left to spend. It could give you that extra sense of control over your finances."
3288,I got called into the CEOs office a number of years ago/I was shocked because they offered a promotion . It sounded like something was wrong,"and what happened? /Yeah, I always get a little anxious when you get pulled in for those meetings.

3297,"The other day I saw a man take a dog from the street , I 've been seeing that dog for a while and in a couple of days I see this dog on the streets again , poor little thing . I thought it 'd have a better life ./I do n't know but it 's a sweetheart , I 'd take it myself if only I did n't have one already .","That's sad, I wonder why the dog can't find a home!/Maybe the poor dog doesn't get along with other dogs.","Oh no, that breaks my heart. I wish there was something I could do to help that sweet dog. It's always hard to see animals suffering on the streets."
3298,"My grandfather passed a year ago today thanks to medical malpractice ./One step at a time basically , I hate he could n't get a good doctor but that was `` the best the VA could do ''/Oh no , I am so sorry to hear that .

Everyone was staring ./No luckily haha but it made me blush for sure .,"Oh geez, that sounds pretty embarrassing. Did any of the bottles break?/That's a shame. If they did, you could've reversed the situation and summoned everybody over to throw down and have a supremo wine fest.",I would feel so embarrassed if that happened to me. I can imagine the awkwardness of having everyone stare. But I love your positive outlook on turning it into a fun wine fest!
3301,I was almost hit by a car while I was walking in a crosswalk and I cursed the lady out . Then I saw a little kid in the car and instantly regretted what I just said ./I know . It was not my proudest moment .,You should feel bad for just cursing at a lady./Did you at least apologized?,"I would feel guilty for reacting in anger and saying hurtful words, especially knowing there was a child present. I would definitely apologize to the woman and try to make amends for my mistake. It's important to acknowledge and learn from moments of weakness and strive to do better in the future."
3302,"I am so happy with my life right now ./Nice advice , thanks.I will make sure I follow the advice .",That must be a great feeling!  Good for you!

Just remember to take a deep breath and try to approach the conversation with a relaxed and friendly attitude. Building a connection with family members can take time, but treating them like a long-time friend can help alleviate some of the pressure."
3319,"There was a traffic jam because people were slowing to look at a wreck on the other side of the highway/It added a lovely 20 minutes to my drive home/Oh no , I hate when that happens .

I used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma I am very anxious as well and I don't care to have people I don't trust around me anyhow. Maybe try meetups or forums where people have the same interests?,"I understand completely how you feel. It can be really hard to open up and trust new people, especially after experiencing trauma. Maybe joining a meetup or online forum with like-minded individuals could be a great way to connect with new friends who share your interests.

She will change her tune.",I would feel sad hearing that someone views their daughter's innocence as a burden instead of a gift. I believe that children are a precious joy and we should nurture and protect their innocence for as long as possible.

Yes zero respect and zero care for even their own things , let alone others . Its sad .","Oh, that sound alful! Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share./It is sad. Espically since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the enviroment better for everyone.

I wish there was more empathy and respect for others and the environment.

I could n't believe it- She had also whipped in , in front of cars with two kids . Seriously why do some people have kids ?","I hate when people do that/I am not sure, that is a good question","I would feel deeply disturbed and saddened by the neglectful actions of the mother.

3427,"Yesterday someone pulled up beside us in the gas station , blasting rap music . I was shocked when a middle aged white guy stepped out . It was super obnoxious , vile music too ./It 's very common here . You have gramma 's doing bad things , walking down the street drunk or drugged etc . But it still shocks me when someone who is a father and grandpa is acting like a bad teen","Wow that is crazy, sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area, sadly! /Yes it is very disgusting, I just don't understand why it takes some people so long to get their act together!","I would feel saddened by the stereotypes and judgments being made based on someone's appearance and behavior.

He might have FAS and he has bipolar so it makes me feel more compassion about his outbursts,I would feel compassionate and understanding towards this person who is standing by their partner despite the challenges they are facing.

3909,"Whenever I see a very expensive car on the road , I get so envious ! One day .../I love Porsches !","I do too. What is your ultimate dream car?/Porches are pretty nice. Not nice as Ford sedans, though.","I understand how you feel, luxury cars can be very tempting to want. Personally, I've always dreamed of owning a Tesla, the technology and sustainability behind them is amazing. But I can see why Porsches are your ultimate dream car too!"
3910,"I 'm going hiking with my friends tomorrow . I have everything I need and I forget bug spray like last time ! I am ready !/A local trail about 5 mi from us .

They love roadkill hahaha,I would be horrified and disgusted by the lack of empathy and respect for the animals. The thought of eating squirrels or using their fur for clothing is deeply upsetting to me. I would not be able to engage in a conversation like that without feeling extremely uncomfortable.
3913,"I stepped in dried dog poop today on my way to my car . It was so nasty !/Haha , maybe next time","Dang, that is some nasty stuff.

3935,Feeling lucky to not have plans/You got that right,"I like not having plans too. I enjoy just relaxing sometimes./I had plans today, but they got canceled.

3936,"My dad was recently diagnosed with diabetes . I 'm really worried what this will mean for his health going forward . He 's in his mid-60 's and I want him to live as long as possible , but this obviously gets in the way of that ./Yeah , my dad has never been a veggies guy . Always sneaking too many desserts . He had a stroke earlier on in his life , too , which has always hampered him , and I think the medications for his heart condition led to the development of the diabetes .

3937,There has been a fly in my room that wo n't stop landing on my face . I am about to lose it .../I know ! ! ! It 's like the fly loves to annoy me lol,"That's one of those things that never gets old to complain about, because it's one of life's time-tested annoyances. And what's worse is you open the door or window for them, and they still refuse to leave.../And you never have a fly-swatter when you need one. Like, who keeps one of those around? Although I always have flip-flops because I live near the coast, so that makes a decent fly-swatter.",I would empathize with the frustration of dealing with a persistent fly. I would probably laugh at the annoyance of the situation and suggest using a flip flop as a makeshift fly-swatter. I might also share my own similar experiences with pesky flies.
3938,"So , I was eating dinner and my dad kept laughing during it , and I wondered why . Turns out he accidentally dropped the plate of meat on the ground outside after grilling it , but decided to serve it to us anyway !/Not to me it was n't !

I bet someone wasn't happy about that. Unless you live alone, in which case, no big deal. Did you just feel like eating it, or were you feeling sad about something?/Ah, the kids.

3962,I was saddened when my dad got in trouble . It just gave me some shame/He got a dwi,What did he do if you don't mind me asking?/Was it his first offense?,I'm so sorry to hear that your dad is going through that.

Just let them know you needed it really bad at the moment and maybe return it?/Yes! You will feel so much better afterwards,"I would feel a mix of shame and regret for my actions, and I would likely struggle with the guilt weighing on me. I would listen to the suggestion of confessing and returning the supplies, as it would bring a sense of relief and resolution to the situation. Ultimately, owning up to my mistake would be the best course of action for my conscience and the wellbeing of my relationship with my coworker."

4998,"When I was a wee lad , I was always afraid of going to sleep . Always thought there was a big ole scary monster lurking in the closet ./I know , right ! ? ! I swear I saw bigfoot a couple of times , but my parents never believed me . Now he is out roaming around the Pacific Northwest somewhere .",I used to think that too. I could sleep if it wasn't closed all the way/And you could have caught him in the closet!!!,I would likely empathize with the fear of monsters in the closet and feeling scared as a child. I might also express curiosity about the possibility of encountering Bigfoot and disbelief that it could have been in the closet. My response would convey understanding and a sense of shared experience with the speaker.
4999,I was robbed at gunpoint once when i worked as a cashier ./Yes he did and I had to testify against him . It was very scary .,Oh wow!  Did the guy get caught?/That would be.  I am so sorry you had to go through that.,"That must have been terrifying for you, I can't imagine how scary it must have been. I'm glad the guy was caught so he couldn't hurt anyone else. You are so brave for testifying against him."
