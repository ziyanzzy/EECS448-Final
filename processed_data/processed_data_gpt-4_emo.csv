I sat in the parking lot for an hour reading a self help book just to be able to 'fake it ' by seeming outgoing ./Surprisingly , yes !

You should own the joint by now.,That's such an incredible transformation! It just goes to show the power that a little self-improvement trick can have. What's the name of that book by the way?

I used to be the social butterfly but now after a lot of trauma I am very anxious as well and I don't care to have people I don't trust around me anyhow. Maybe try meetups or forums where people have the same interests?,"I completely understand where you're coming from, and it's perfectly normal to feel this way.

Yes zero respect and zero care for even their own things , let alone others . Its sad .","Oh, that sound alful! Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share./It is sad. Espically since if the same people acted like they cared and wanted to they could help make the enviroment better for everyone. ","I completely agree with you both. It's really disheartening to see such careless and disrespectful behavior, especially in a community setting where shared resources are scarce.
